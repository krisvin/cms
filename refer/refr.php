    Complaints Management Solution

Competitive and regulatory pressures are forcing organizations to change the way they handle, manage, respond to, and report customer complaints. MetricStream Complaints Management Solution comprehensively manages complaints from customers and channel partners. The real-time visibility provided by the complaints management software solution enables organizations to track each complaint through its lifecycle from recording and initiation, to investigation, reporting, and closure, following the appropriate process to ensure that nothing slips through the cracks.

A powerful analytics and reporting capability with graphical dashboards helps managers perform trend analyses and spot recurring problems. Based on a complaint, managers can drive root cause analyses in a timely manner, and trigger internal or supplier corrective and preventive action (CAPA). At the enterprise level, organizations can increase customer satisfaction and retention through improved responsiveness. Rigorous management of customer complaints also drives continuous improvement and regulatory compliance.

Complaint Recording and Routing: MetricStream Complaints Management Solution enables customer service representatives and complaints managers to initiate a product or service complaint coming from multiple sources such as phone, fax, email, or the web. All crucial details and parameters about the product as well as the incident are captured. The system guides the user by dynamically enabling, disabling, mandating, or defaulting fields based on the data that is entered. Drop-down menus, logical validations, and auto-fill capabilities boost complaints management efficiency, and ensure accuracy of information. Depending on the complaint parameters, the case is automatically routed for investigation, response, and reporting. Notifications are sent to relevant departments and personnel, and escalation mechanisms are triggered based on the severity and priority of the case.

Investigation and Response: Complaints investigation is driven by collaborative workflows that ensure responsiveness by assigning investigative tasks to an individual or a team with due dates based on the complaint severity level. References to information on product samples, test protocols, and related incidents support effective root cause analyses. The investigation response with the proposed action plan is routed to complaints managers for review and implementation. Failure to complete the investigation in time leads to escalation.

Regulatory Reporting and Submissions: Embedded best practices for pharmaceutical and medical device industries, combined with decision tree functionality supports the identification of reportable events as well as the type of report (e.g. 5-day, 30-day). The process of reporting is simplified as the system automatically generates mandatory reports in formats and layouts prescribed by the FDA and other regional regulatory agencies (e.g.MedWatch Form 3500A, Baseline Report Form 3417, adverse event reporting). The reports are generated in standard file types such as MS Word and can be further worked on before they are submitted to the agency.

Reports and Metrics: MetricStream Complaints Management Solution provides complete visibility into the complaints database and lifecycle with comprehensive aggregate reporting and individual case status tracking. The system's ability to associate various complaint types for spotting trends and common sources of complaints ensures timely preventive actions. Graphical executive dashboards provide statistics and data by a variety of complaints parameters, such as type, product, status, due date, closure time, plant, region, and lots. A unique drill-down capability takes the user down to the finest level of detail to see the underlying data. The system also provides quick access to graphical scorecards or tabular data that can be easily exported in industry standard formats and layouts.
